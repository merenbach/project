	<p>With the Caesar cipher (which may have other common names), the ciphertext alphabet remains in order but is shifted by a certain number of places.  Julius Caesar allegedly employed this monoalphabetic substitution cipher, with a shift of three letters, for military purposes.</p>
	<p>Example alphabets:</p>
<pre>
Shift:      3
Cleartext:  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Ciphertext: DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC
</pre>
<pre>
Shift:      16
Cleartext:  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Ciphertext: QRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP
</pre>
